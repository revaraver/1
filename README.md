00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.758
Hi again. 
It's Matt, 

2
00:00:01.758 --> 00:00:05.403
and now we're talking more about 
strategic reasoning. 

3
00:00:05.403 --> 00:00:10.896
And in particular let's go through and 
and analyze the Keynes beauty contest 

4
00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:14.651
game now and talk about the Nash 
equilibria of this game. 

5
00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:17.541
So, remember what the structure of this 
game was. 

6
00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:22.099
Each player named an integer between 1 
and 100, so you've got a population of 

7
00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.452
players, 
they're all naming integers. 

8
00:00:24.452 --> 00:00:30.125
the person who names the integer closest 
to 2/3 of the average integer named by 

9
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:33.634
people wins, other people don't get 
anything. 

10
00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:36.758
ties are broken uniformly at random. 
Okay. 

11
00:00:36.758 --> 00:00:42.681
So again, what are other players going to 
do? You have to reason through that and 

12
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:47.012
then what should I do in response? So 
these are the key ingredients of a Nash 

13
00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:51.445
equilibrium and the Nash equilibrium is 
everybody's choosing their optimal 

14
00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:55.789
response, the one that's going to give 
them the maximum chance of winning in 

15
00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.521
this game to what the other players are 
doing, 

16
00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:02.323
that's going to be a Nash equilibrium. 
Okay. So let's take a look. 

17
00:01:02.323 --> 00:01:06.880
so, how are we going to reason about 
this? Suppose that I think that the 

18
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.020
average play the averaged integer named 
in this game is going to be some number 

19
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.740
X. 
so, I, you know, including my own 

20
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.561
integer, 
I think this is going to be the average. 

21
00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:22.081
Well, what has to be true about my reply 
to that, my reply should be 2/3 of X, 

22
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:26.769
right? I should be naming the integer 
closest to 2/3 of whatever I believe the 

23
00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:30.578
average is going to be. 
So my optimal strategy should be naming 

24
00:01:30.578 --> 00:01:34.546
an integer closest to 2/3 of X. 
So here, we're just working through 

25
00:01:34.546 --> 00:01:39.344
heuristically, we'll, we'll get to formal 
definitions and analysis in a little bit, 

26
00:01:39.344 --> 00:01:42.282
but let's just go through the basic 
reasoning now. 

27
00:01:42.282 --> 00:01:47.134
Okay, so I should be trying to name 2/3 
of what I think the average is going to 

28
00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:49.596
be. 
Well, X has to be less than a 100, right? 

29
00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:53.096
There's no way that the average guess can 
be more then 100. 

30
00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:57.578
So the optimal strategy for any player 
should be no more then 67 right? So if I 

31
00:01:57.578 --> 00:02:03.299
think that everybody's rational I, so, if 
I believe that's true, then I think that 

32
00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.867
nobody should be naming an integer bigger 
than 67. 

33
00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:12.477
Okay, so what does that mean? Well, that 
means that I can't think the average is 

34
00:02:12.477 --> 00:02:17.590
any higher than 67, right? So, 
if, if the average X is no bigger than 

35
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.980
67, then I should be naming no more than 
2/3 of 67. 

36
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.495
Right? Now, you can begin to see where 
this is going, so that means that if I 

37
00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:31.917
think everybody else understands the game 
and understands that nobody should be 

38
00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:36.757
naming a number bigger than 67 and nobody 
should be naming numbers bigger than 2/3 

39
00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:39.507
of 67. 
we keep going on this, so nobody should 

40
00:02:39.507 --> 00:02:42.352
be naming anything more than 2/3 of this, 
of 2/3 of 67. 

41
00:02:42.352 --> 00:02:46.677
Now, obviously, when you, if you just 
keep looking, everybody's going to want 

42
00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:49.592
to be a little bit lower than everybody 
else's guess. 

43
00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:53.172
So wherever the average is you should be 
lower than that. 

44
00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:58.108
What's the only number which, everybody 
can be naming, and consistently choosing 

45
00:02:58.108 --> 00:03:01.369
the best response they have to what the 
average guess is. 

46
00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:05.889
the unique Nash equilibrium of this game 
is for every player to announce one. 

47
00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.678
Okay? Well that's, yeah, 
so, so we're driven all the way down to, 

48
00:03:09.678 --> 00:03:14.236
to announcing one and that's a unique 
Nash equilibrium, and what happens now, 

49
00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:17.978
we all announce one we all tie, and 
somebody wins at random. 

50
00:03:17.978 --> 00:03:22.429
If, if I try to deviate form that, if I 
try to announce a higher integer, I'd 

51
00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:26.971
just be higher than the average guess, 
so I wouldn't be at 2/3 of the mean. 

52
00:03:26.971 --> 00:03:29.581
So this is going to be a stable point. 
Okay? 

53
00:03:29.581 --> 00:03:33.532
So, let's see what, what actually happens 
when people play this. 

54
00:03:33.532 --> 00:03:38.392
So part of this reasoning is you're 
trying to form expectations of what other 

55
00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:43.227
players are doing and you need to make 
sure that those expectations actually 

56
00:03:43.227 --> 00:03:46.425
match reality. 
So let's have a peek at some plays of 

57
00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:50.024
this game. 
So this, this is a plot here where we're 

58
00:03:50.024 --> 00:03:55.553
actually giving you the results of the 
online course of when it was taught last 

59
00:03:55.553 --> 00:03:59.879
year, we had players play this game, and 
so these are the results. 

60
00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.445
And here from 2012, we had more than 
10,000 people actually participate in 

61
00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:09.085
this particular game. 
What do we see? So, down here on this, we 

62
00:04:09.085 --> 00:04:15.142
have integers going from 0 to 100 and 
then over here, we have the frequency. 

63
00:04:15.142 --> 00:04:21.088
So, how many people named the given 
integer? So the, the 50 right here is 

64
00:04:21.088 --> 00:04:23.693
the, is the mode, so we get the mode of 
50. 

65
00:04:23.693 --> 00:04:27.742
The most often named integer was 50, 
1,600 people named 50. 

66
00:04:27.742 --> 00:04:33.310
Well, obviously, they hadn't gone through 
all the reasoning and it takes a while to 

67
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.106
sort of figure out what the equilibrium 
of this game is. 

68
00:04:37.106 --> 00:04:42.172
what's the mean here? So the mean was 34, 
so actually there's some interesting 

69
00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:44.930
things. 
Some people naming 100, a number that 

70
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.704
could never really win, right? 
So it's not clear exactly what what, it 

71
00:04:49.704 --> 00:04:54.130
could, it could end up winning if 
everybody named 100 then you could end up 

72
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.465
in a tie there, but then you would be 
better off naming 67 instead. 

73
00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:03.227
So so when we, when we end up looking 
through this, what we end up with is some 

74
00:05:03.227 --> 00:05:06.634
people naming high numbers, but very few 
people, 

75
00:05:06.634 --> 00:05:12.432
then we end up with some interesting 
spikes a bunch of people just named 50. 

76
00:05:12.432 --> 00:05:16.012
Not clear exactly what the reasoning is 
on, on 50. 

77
00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:22.192
interestingly if you think that a bunch 
of people are going to do that you might 

78
00:05:22.192 --> 00:05:26.512
want to name 2/3 of 50. 
Okay, well, there's a big spike here at 

79
00:05:26.512 --> 00:05:32.162
33 where a bunch of people believed that 
other people were going to name 50. 

80
00:05:32.162 --> 00:05:37.070
if we keep going, so down here. 
If we keep going and looking at this, 

81
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.413
what we see, then we see another spike at 
2/3 of 33. 

82
00:05:40.413 --> 00:05:44.657
So some people said, okay, well, maybe a 
bunch of people are going to think that 

83
00:05:44.657 --> 00:05:48.317
the average is going to be 50, they are 
going to name 33. 

84
00:05:48.317 --> 00:05:52.830
I'm going to go one better than that. 
I am going to name something around 22, 

85
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.980
23. 
you know what the winner in this game 

86
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.168
was? The winner was actually 23. 
So 2/3 of the average guess here was 

87
00:06:01.168 --> 00:06:06.532
about 23 because the mean was, was 34 and 
so one of these people randomly would end 

88
00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:12.099
up being the winner of this game. Okay? 
there's actually a spike of people who 

89
00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:18.104
went all the way to the Nash equilibrium 
and it's interesting here, because the 

90
00:06:18.104 --> 00:06:22.230
Nash equilibrium works if you believe 
that everyone else is going to name the 

91
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.579
integer one, then that's your best 
response. 

92
00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:28.907
But, in situations where a bunch of 
people don't necessarily understand the 

93
00:06:28.907 --> 00:06:32.974
game and haven't reasoned through it, 
then you actually would be better off 

94
00:06:32.974 --> 00:06:36.510
naming a higher number. 
So Nash equilibrium is a stable point if 

95
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.007
everybody figures it out and everybody 
abides by it, then it's the best thing 

96
00:06:41.007 --> 00:06:45.367
you can do but it might be that some of 
the players aren't necessarily figuring 

97
00:06:45.367 --> 00:06:48.452
out exactly what goes on. 
Okay. Now suppose you, you start with 

98
00:06:48.452 --> 00:06:52.847
this game and they're not necessarily 
playing the Nash equilibrium, but now we 

99
00:06:52.847 --> 00:06:56.217
have them play it again. 
Right? So, they get to do this, play it 

100
00:06:56.217 --> 00:06:59.812
again, and then see what happens. 
Well, now, these people should realize 

101
00:06:59.812 --> 00:07:03.817
that they overestimated, right? There's a 
bunch of people here who are naming 

102
00:07:03.817 --> 00:07:08.012
numbers too high, they should be moving 
their announcements to, to lower numbers, 

103
00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:12.054
right? They should be moving down. 
And if, if, if I anticipate that 

104
00:07:12.054 --> 00:07:16.709
everybody's going to adjust and move 
downwards I should move my announcement 

105
00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:20.208
downwards as well. 
So let's have a peek at what happens. 

106
00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:25.063
So here is, is a subset of players 
actually from, from one of the classes I, 

107
00:07:25.063 --> 00:07:28.736
I did on campus, 
where they got, this is the second play 

108
00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:31.301
of the game. 
So after the first play, then we have 

109
00:07:31.301 --> 00:07:34.283
them play again. 
Now you can begin to see that things, you 

110
00:07:34.283 --> 00:07:38.105
know, the, the 50s have disappeared, 
all the numbers up here have disappeared, 

111
00:07:38.105 --> 00:07:41.504
people have moved down, 
and in fact, a lot more people have are 

112
00:07:41.504 --> 00:07:45.677
moving towards the equilibrium once you 
get to the second part, the second 

113
00:07:45.677 --> 00:07:48.306
chance. 
So if you've played this game, you begin 

114
00:07:48.306 --> 00:07:51.842
to see the logic of it. 
You played again and now we get closer to 

115
00:07:51.842 --> 00:07:54.715
Nash equilibrium. 
So, Nash equilibrium does is a better 

116
00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:58.254
predictor here. 
if from experienced players who have 

117
00:07:58.254 --> 00:08:03.219
played this game understood it and, and 
interacting with the same population, you 

118
00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:06.948
can begin to see things unraveling and 
moving back towards 

119
00:08:06.948 --> 00:08:10.418
all announcing one. 
Okay. So Nash equilibrium, basic ideas, a 

120
00:08:10.418 --> 00:08:16.040
consistent list of actions, so each 
player is maximizing his or her payouts 

121
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.680
given the actions of the other players. 
Should be self-consistent and stable. 

122
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.613
the nice parts about this, each players 
action is maximizing what they can get 

123
00:08:27.613 --> 00:08:32.867
given the other players. 
nobody has an incentive to deviate from 

124
00:08:32.867 --> 00:08:36.242
their action if an equilibrium profile 
is, is played. 

125
00:08:36.242 --> 00:08:41.492
someone does have an incentive to deviate 
from a profile of actions that do not 

126
00:08:41.492 --> 00:08:45.742
form an equilibrium. 
So these are the basic ideas and we'll be 

127
00:08:45.742 --> 00:08:49.112
looking at, at Nash equilibrium in much 
more detail. 

128
00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:52.975
So, in terms of of, of making 
predictions, you know, why, should we 

129
00:08:52.975 --> 00:08:57.615
expect Nash equilibrium to be played? 
Well, I, I think there is sort of 

130
00:08:57.615 --> 00:09:01.272
interesting logic here. 
in this logic, actually goes back to, to 

131
00:09:01.272 --> 00:09:06.380
some of the original discussion by Nash. 
when we want to make a prediction of 

132
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.488
what's going on a game we want something 
which if players really understood 

133
00:09:11.488 --> 00:09:16.812
things, it would be consistent. 
And the interesting thing is we should 

134
00:09:16.812 --> 00:09:21.607
expect non-equilibria not to be stable, 
in the sense that, if players understood 

135
00:09:21.607 --> 00:09:25.572
it and see what happens in a 
non-equilibrium, they should move away 

136
00:09:25.572 --> 00:09:28.522
from that. 
And we saw exactly that in the, in the, 

137
00:09:28.522 --> 00:09:32.927
the second round of the, the beauty 
contest game, then people start moving 

138
00:09:32.927 --> 00:09:36.937
down toward the Nash equilibrium. 
So it's not necessarily true that we 

139
00:09:36.937 --> 00:09:40.272
always expect equilibrium to be played, 
[COUGH] but we should expect 

140
00:09:40.272 --> 00:09:44.292
non-equilibrium to vanish over time. 
And the, there'll be various dynamics and 

141
00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:48.817
other kinds of settings where there will 
be strong pushes towards equilibrium over 

142
00:09:48.817 --> 00:09:52.897
time, but they might have to be learned 
and they might have to evolve and, and so 

143
00:09:52.897 --> 00:09:55.332
forth. 
So, as this course goes on, we'll talk 

144
00:09:55.332 --> 00:09:59.222
more and more about some of the dynamics 
and, and things to push towards Nash 

145
00:09:59.222 --> 00:09:59.895
equilibrium.
